					The game can be played by 2 to 10 people. Each player in Texas Hold'em is dealt two cards.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the distribution, the betting begins, which takes place over several rounds.
				</p>
				<p>
					The two players to the left of the dealer make mandatory bets, which are charged before the start of
					bidding. This is done in order to encourage players to play actively. These mandatory bets are called
					blinds. These are the rules of poker.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are a beginner, then know that during the hand it is more profitable to have a late position in
					order to track the moves of your opponents. These are not poker rules, but rather a kind of tactical
					move.
					After the players have posted the blinds, the first stage of betting begins.
				</p>
				<p>
					The rules of the game of poker imply the presence of certain actions that the player performs in the
					process of trading:
				</p>
				<ul class="popup__list">
					<li class="popup__item">Put, bet (eng. bet) - place a bet </li>
					<li class="popup__item">Answer, call (eng. call) - bet the same amount as the opponent put - call </li>
					<li class="popup__item">Raise, raise (English raise) - increase the bet - bet more than rivals </li>
					<li class="popup__item">Discard cards, fold (eng. fold) - refuse to further participate in the game and
						discard cards </li>
					<li class="popup__item">Skip, check (English check) - in situations where the bet has already been made
						or bets have not been made by opponents - do not add anything to the pot, leave "as is" </li>
					<li class="popup__item">The betting round ends when all players have made equal bets or folded. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					After the first round of betting, if more than one person remains in the hand, then, according to the
					rules of poker, three common open cards are placed on the table, which are called the flop. Community
					cards must be used to make combinations.

					The game begins with a roll of six-sided dice. They are called dice. If the marking of the cubes is
					correct, then the faces of the dice should total seven: six opposite one, five opposite two, four
					opposite three. Incorrect markup can be used in fraud.
				</p>
				<p>
					Craps is played with a number of dice from one to five pieces (depending on the style of play) at a large
					table, with specific markings applied and with a considerable number of places for bets.
				</p>
				<p>
					The game "Craps" can be divided into two main stages: Come Out Roll (the first throw of the shooter) and
					Point Roll (throw after the establishment of the Point number). The shooter rolls the dice, and the
					amount of points rolled determines the further course of the game.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a 7 or 11 rolls, the shooter wins immediately and gets to roll the dice again.
					If a 2, 3, or 12 rolls, the shooter immediately loses and passes the dice to another player.
					If a 4, 5, 6, 8, or 9 is rolled, that number is called a Point and the game moves on to the next stage,
					the Point Roll. Here the shooter will roll the dice until the Point or 7 set by him falls out. In the
					first case, he will win, in the second he will lose.

					Simple, dynamic and addictive game. The player makes bets on one or more boxes indicated on the table.
					After the dealer's words "No more bets" and the gesture to close the bets with the hand, the players
					cannot touch and change their bets.
				</p>

				<p>
					First, the player receives two face-up cards, the sum of the points of which allows him to decide whether
					he needs additional cards or not. The goal of the game is to score 21 points or close to it. If a player
					scores more than 21 points, then his bet loses. If the sum of points on the dealer's cards is greater
					than 21, then all bets remaining in the game win.
				</p>

				<p>
					Players who score more points than the dealer win, their bets are paid 1:1.
					Players with less points than the dealer lose.
					If the sum of the player's points is equal to the sum of the dealer's points, then a "draw" or Stay is
					declared: the player's bet does not win or lose.
				</p>

				<p>
					The dealer draws cards last, while he must take a card if he has 16 points or less, and stop if the total
					points are 17 or more. Aces are counted as 1 or 11, "pictures" (jacks, queens and kings) - all 10 points
					each, the rest of the cards correspond to their face value.
				</p>

				<p>
					"BLACK JACK"
				</p>

				<p>
					This is a combination on the first two cards from the hand, giving a total of 21 points (ace and ten or
					ace
					and “picture”). In this case, the player's bets are paid 3:2 if the dealer does not have the same
					combination. Blackjack wins against any other combination of cards, including combinations with a total
					of
					21 points.
				</p>

				<p>
					SURRENDER
				</p>

				<p>
					After the distribution of the first two cards to all the playing boxes, the player can refuse to continue
					the game on any number of his boxes, losing half of the corresponding bets. This can be done before the
					third card hits the box they want to SURRENDER to. The player cannot SURRENDER if the dealer's first card
					is
					an ace.
				</p>

				<p>
					SPLIT
				</p>

				<p>
					If the player's first two cards are of the same value, that is, they have the same value in terms of
					points,
					then they can be divided. In this case, the player makes an additional bet on this box, equal to the
					initial
					one, and collects cards for each card separately. All pairs of identical cards can be split no more than
					three times. Aces are an exception. Splitting aces is allowed twice, and when splitting, the player
					receives
					only one card for each of the aces. Ace and ten (picture) combination obtained after the split is
					considered
					as 21 and is not a Blackjack combination.
				</p>

				<p>
					DOUBLE
				</p>

				<p>
					After the player has received the first two cards, regardless of the number of points, he can double his
					bet, while receiving only one card. Doubling is allowed after splitting the cards. If the player has 9,
					10
					and 11 points, then the dealer will always offer to double the player's bet.
				</p>

				<p>
					INSURANCE (INSURANCE)
				</p>

				<p>
					If the dealer's first card is an ace, then the player can make an additional bet, but not more than half
					of
					the initial bets and not less than half of the table minimum, placing it on the field marked Insurance
					(insurance). This bet wins if the dealer has Blackjack and pays 2:1, loses in all other cases.
				</p>

				<p>
					Players can also insure their box against Blackjack at the dealer when the dealer's first card is 10. In
					this case, the dealer does not announce insurance.
				</p>

				<p>
					EVEN MONEY (EQUAL MONEY)
				</p>

				<p>
					If the player has Blackjack, and the dealer has the first card an ace, then before the start of a set of
					cards for the first playing box, the player can receive equal money, i.e. payment for the box, equal to
					his
					bet 1:1. If the player refuses equal money, and the dealer has a Blackjack, then the player's bet is not
					paid, i.e. it does not win and does not lose.
				</p>

				<p>
					NOTES
				</p>

				<p>
					Up to three players can play on one box. The bet of each of them must not be less than the minimum of the
					table, and the total bet on the box must not exceed the maximum of the table.
				</p>

				<p>
					The player himself controls the number of points on his boxes and checks them for compliance with the
					value
					announced by the dealer.
					In case of incorrect distribution of cards or other error of the dealer, no payments are made to the
					players.

				<p>
					One of the main hurdles when trying to win big on slot machines is the sheer amount of slot machine myths
					and misconceptions about playing and winning at one of them. Because of the nature of the game, in which
					no
					skill can be applied or used to win, it is easy for people to invent and come up with false strategies
					and
					misconceptions, and for unsuspecting players to believe in them.
				</p>

				<p>
					Slots get hot at night <br>
					This is usually for slot machines in real live casinos. This comes from the experience of many people who
					have seen someone hit the jackpot in a casino at night. While it may be true, slot machines getting "hot"
					or
					reaching the point where they're about to hit the jackpot has nothing to do with the time of day.
				</p>

				<p>
					The reason why some machines give out a big win at night is that there are much more online players in
					the
					evening than during the day. That is why the probability of hitting the jackpot in the evening is higher.
				</p>

				<p>
					Online slots rigged <br>
					This is one of the oldest and most common slot machine myths in brick and mortar casinos, and it has
					spread
					to online slots. Being launched with computers and over the Internet, people have come to the conclusion
					that online slots are rigged. However, unless you are playing at an illegal online casino, this cannot be
					the case.
				</p>

				<p>
					Certified online slots are regularly reviewed and reviewed for their safety, security and fairness to
					players. Please note that licensed casinos usually host certified online slots. Also, legal slot game
					play
					is not determined by any pre-programmed set of results, but rather by a random sequence of results thanks
					to
					a random number generator. This algorithm ensures that all results are randomized and do not have any
					noticeable patterns that would make them predictable.
				</p>

				<p>
					By playing online slots for longer, you increase your chances <br>
					This is due to a misconception by slot players that the longer you sit at a slot machine and play it for
					hours, the higher your chances of winning. We can say that this makes sense, since the more a slot
					machine
					is played, the more likely it is that it will eventually pay off and hit a big jackpot.
				</p>

				<p>
					However, the problem with this "strategy" is that the time you will play will not cover the time of the
					slot
					machine's jackpot payout. After all, even with a very small chance, slots can give out a big jackpot at
					any
					given time. The high level of variance is the reason why your chances of hitting the jackpot are slim.
					You
					can play a slot for eight hours straight and not hit the jackpot, but someone can sit on it for just ten
					minutes and bring home a big bag of money.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finding Legitimate Online Slots <br>
					Let's say you're serious about strategizing how to win big at online slots. In this case, the most
					effective
					and perhaps the easiest way to ensure that you have the best chance of winning is to find a legitimate
					online casino offering legitimate slot games.
				</p>

				<p>
					Licensed online slots and platforms <br>
					If an online casino is licensed, it also comes with the assurance that its games are safe and secure.
					After
					all, part of licensing is the regular review and audit of games and platforms in general.
				</p>

				<p>
					While this list is far from complete, there are some of the best legit sites where you can play online
					slots.
				</p>

				<p>
					Online Casino Security Measures <br>
					Even if you are playing at an online casino with a real license and registration, you still need to take
					precautions for your safety, as well as the safety of your money and personal information. This includes
					several things such as using a gambling VPN to secure your location and IP address, using an antivirus to
					protect against malware, and using a set of secure and strong passwords for your accounts.
				</p>

				<p>
					Online casino not blacklisted <br>
					Online casinos can be blacklisted for many reasons: customer late payment, unprofessional customer
					service,
					gameplay issues, and more. Blacklisted casinos are not necessarily unregistered. Some of them are fully
					registered but offer unprofessional and dubious services. Thus, look for the site you want to play on for
					reviews and other potential red flags.
				</p>

				<p>
					Knowing how to win a lot of money in online slots includes knowing how the system works and how to make
					it
					work to your advantage. While strategy may not be available and skills may not apply, knowing how things
					work increases your chances of winning.

					The rules of playing roulette in a casino are not complicated or intricate, or the “ferris wheel” is a
					round-shaped drum, which, as a rule, consists of 38 numbered cells. The numbering starts with a single
					zero, followed by a double zero and the numbers from one to thirty-six in a circle. The numbers
					alternate: odd pairs are split by even pairs. Cells are alternately colored red and black. The dealer
					spins the drum and tosses a small ball in the opposite direction of the wheel. When the movement of the
					roulette slows down, it becomes clear which of the cells the ball hit.

					Pai Gow poker rules
				</p>
				<p>
					The basic basis is very simple - it's double hand poker:
				</p>
				<p>
					The dealer gives all participants 7 cards. <br>
					Each player divides them independently into 2 sets. And he holds them in different hands - right and
					left, so that they have 5 and 2 cards. <br>
					In this case, the distribution is carried out in such a way that the pair is weaker than the five. <br>
					When the hands are revealed, the winner is the owner of the stronger combinations. <br>
					There is a situation when one of the combinations of the player is strong, the second is weaker, and then
					the game comes to a draw. <br>
					If the value is equal, the victory is awarded to the dealer. <br>

					There are three ways to play in KENO. You can play in one, two or three ways at the same time. The price
					of
					the ticket varies depending on the number of ways chosen.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first way: "Choose a combination" <br>
					There are 80 numbers in the KENO ticket. You can choose from 1 to 10 numbers. The more numbers you guess,
					the bigger the winnings will be.
				</p>

				<p>
					The second way: "Guess the parity" <br>
					There will be 20 numbers in the draw. Guess which numbers in the draw will be more - even or odd. If you
					choose even or odd and guess right, you win 170 ₽. If you choose "equally" and guess right - 340 ₽.
				</p>

				<p>
					Third method: "Column selection" <br>
					There are 10 columns in the playing field of the Keno ticket. Choose which column will have more numbers
					in
					the draw than the others. If you guess right, you win 700 ₽.
				</p>

				<p>
					super prize <br>
					The KENO draw takes place in two rounds. The super prize is played in the first round.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is won by tickets whose numbers match the 9-digit tour combination. If the ticket number contains less
					than 9 numbers, then the missing numbers are considered to be on the left and equal to zero. For example,
					your ticket number is 97. You win if the combination is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 7. The winning
					combination
					is formed from left to right. The winning ticket in the first round also participates in the drawing of
					the
					second round.
